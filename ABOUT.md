- I've used PHP, version 7.1 since I am more familiar with this language, so choosing it saved my time to learn/remember other languages.

- I've used Lumen 5.6 which is the latest Laravel micro PHP framework, I picked it since no need to load a big framework for this assignment, and also I've removed a lot of unneeded files and folders to make it more lite since the assignment needs the minimum requirements from the framework.

- I have a good experience with php, but about Laravel I've learned it by myself one year ago so I am not that expert with it.

- What I learned from this assignment is how to deal with Heroku and Travis-ci since I haven't heard about them before.
